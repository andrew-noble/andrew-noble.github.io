      Hi there, I am new web developer, throwing stuff on the internet for
      practice. Below are some links to stuff I've made
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="./public/first-webpage.html">My very first webpage</a>, to
        remember when I get employed as a freelancer and become a digital nomad
      </li>
      <li>
        An HTML version of my <a href="./public/resume.html">resume</a>, which
        mostly has stuff from when I was working as a robotics engineer
