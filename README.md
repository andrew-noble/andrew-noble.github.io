Hi! I am learning about web development and this repo is me spinning up my own personal website. It will eventually house a portfolio of projects in addition to my other interests like outdoor adventure, woodworking and writing.

Over the course of learning web development, I have adopted an inclination toward simplicity amidst the dizzying web tool and framework landscape. As such, this website is vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. I think it will stay that way!
