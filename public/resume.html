<h2>Hello, </h2>
<p>
  I love hands-on design work along the electro-mechanical interface including
  firmware, sensors, actuators and robotics. Natural communicator with robust
  collaborative and mentorship ability. I have a work history in agricultural
  robotics, but currently I am checking out new possibilities in computing,
  specifically web development.
