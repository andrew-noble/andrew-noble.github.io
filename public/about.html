<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is andrew noble, I am from southcentral Alaska originally, but have
  also spent time in California and Colorado.
</p>

<p>
  I studied mechanical engineering at Cal Poly, worked at a robotics startup for
  about 2 years. It wasnt my jam so now I am trying new things.
</p>

<p>
  My greatest joys in life are learning new things and moving my body outside.
  In 2021 I hiked the 2650-mi Pacific Crest Trail!
